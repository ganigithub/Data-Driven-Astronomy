## Hello Space Enthusiasts! ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

I'm Ganesh Nagarvani and I was always curious about Space, Time, Stars, Planets, Black Holes, Supernova and what not. I'm also Data Enthusiast so what a great change to combine 
both Data and Astronomy in Data Driven Astronomy.

In this repo, I've saved my learnings about integration of Data with Astronomy.

Things I've learned in DDA:

- How to deal with large amounts of data.
- How to optimise code to enhance the performance and reduce search time.
- Which model is better for what type of data.
- Optimisation Techniques.
- Benifit of SQL (PostgreSQL) over python and how few commands of SQL can give desired results quickly.
- How space data answered decades of unanswerd questions. And many more....
